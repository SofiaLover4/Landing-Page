# Landing-Page
Second major project from the Odin Project. This one deals more with boxes along with the other things I've learned like HTML and CSS.

This is my take two at a project. Hopefully my skills have become more advanced from when I started. I also really need to work on my typing so lets hope it gets faster as time goes on. I'm also going to try having better commit messages this time around so lets see how that goes as well.
