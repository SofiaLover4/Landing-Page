# Landing-Page
Second major project from the Odin Project. This one deals more with boxes along with the other things I've learned like HTML and CSS.

This is my take two at a project. Hopefully my skills have become more advanced from when I started. I also really need to work on my typing so lets hope it gets faster as time goes on. I'm also going to try having better commit messages this time around so lets see how that goes as well.

// Final Thoughts //

Well now that I finished I realize that there is so much more to learn about HTML and CSS but I do find the two very interesting. The end was a struggle for me but I completed. What I don't like was how unorganized all the work was. I know there were many things that could have been done better and styles that did not need to be created if I had just had better organization. However, this does not mean I am not happy with the final product. For my first time making a full page like this, I like the way it came out and I can't wait for any future pages to top this one.
